# Meeting Record January 14, 2025

The discussion's primary focus was on team members' past gaming experiences and the game elements they hope to incorporate. The proposed elements are as follows:

1. Developing the game with an RPG framework as the core.
2. Reference games include:
    - **Pokemon** (monster mechanics),
    - **Rusty Lake** (puzzle-solving and escape room elements),
    - **Stardew Valley** (farming, market economy, and more complex economic models).
3. Additional elements under consideration:
    - Chinese-style horror,
    - Romance.

The **prototype** is expected to be presented during the midterm evaluation, which is scheduled for one month from now. The current approach uses **Stardew Valley** as the foundational layer, with plans to gradually integrate other elements later.

Currently, the primary focus is on game programming, particularly learning **`p5.js`**, implementing in-game interactions, and managing function calls between different modules. Additional features, such as battles, romance, and puzzles, will be refined and integrated during the storyline development phase.
